## Description
This website is a 6 question quiz that determines if the user should learn Java, JavaScript, or C#.  First, it will prompt the user to input their name, and then it takes them to the quiz.  Then, they will answer the questions and hit submit.  Based off their answers, choosing a majority of A will give the user JavaScript, half A half B will give them C#, and a majority of B will give them Java.  If the user does not fill out all of the blanks, they will be notified that they need to answer every question.
